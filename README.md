# Spaceduck terminal theme ðŸš€ðŸ¦†

A intergalactic space theme for your terminal! This is the spaceduck repo for terminal themes. If you're looking for other applications here's the link to the [spaceduck home](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck).

**Color Disclaimer:**

I've personally swapped the yellow and purple colors in most terminal themes.
This is a personal preference as I've found it to render the colorscheme how I like since Spaceduck is dark purple oriented. Feel free to change the colorscheme locally to be more semantically correct! I'm open to change the repo here if any bugs are found however.
Take a look at [this thread](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-terminal/pull/2) to see the visual differences at this change.

## Iterm2

To get the theme into [Iterm](https://iterm2.com/), download the `spaceduck.itermcolors` file and [import it into your settings](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).

## Terminal.app MacOS

To get the theme into the [Mac Terminal app](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)>), download the `spaceduck.terminal` file and import it into your settings.

## Alacritty

The color scheme for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is in the `spaceduck.yml` file or you can copy it here!

```YAML
# Space Duck
colors:
  # Default colors
  primary:
    background: '#0f111b'
    foreground: '#ecf0c1'
  # Normal colors
  normal:
    black:   '#000000'
    red:     '#e33400'
    green:   '#5ccc96'
    yellow:  '#b3a1e6'
    blue:    '#00a3cc'
    magenta: '#f2ce00'
    cyan:    '#7a5ccc'
    white:   '#686f9a'

  # Bright colors
  bright:
    black:   '#686f9a'
    red:     '#e33400'
    green:   '#5ccc96'
    yellow:  '#b3a1e6'
    blue:    '#00a3cc'
    magenta: '#f2ce00'
    cyan:    '#7a5ccc'
    white:   '#f0f1ce'
```

## st

The color theme for [st](https://st.suckless.org/) is located in `spaceduck.h`, open `config.h` (usually in `~/.local/src/st`), search for `static const char *colorname`, delete that part of the configuration until `unsigned int defaultcs = 257;` replace that with the content of `spaceduck.h`, save the file and exit your editor, then run `sudo make install` where st is located to recompile it, close the terminal and launch the terminal again and _voila!_, you should have spaceduck up and running!

## Kitty

The Color theme for [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is in the `spaceduck.conf` file or you can copy it here!

```YAML
  background #0f111b

  cursor #ecf0c1
  selection_background #686f9a

## Windows Terminal

```JSON
"schemes": [
        {
            "name": "SpaceDuck",
            "foreground": "#ecf0c1",
            "background": "#0f111b",
            "black": "#000000",
            "red": "#e33400",
            "green": "#5ccc96",
            "yellow": "#b3a1e6",
            "blue": "#00a3cc",
            "purple": "#f2ce00",
            "cyan": "#7a5ccc",
            "white": "#686f9a",

            "brightCyan": "#7a5ccc",
            "brightWhite": "#f0f1ce"
        }
```

## Tmux

You can go ahead and check out [readme for tmux here](./tmux/README.md).

But if you're too lazy to click the link you can put this in your tmux.conf for an easy spaceduck themed bottom bar:

```tmux
  # Basic color support setting
  set-option -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

  # Default bar color
  set-option -g status-style bg='#1b1c36',fg='#ecf0c1'

  # Active Pane
  set -g pane-active-border-style "fg=#5ccc96"

  # Inactive Pane
  set -g pane-border-style "fg=#686f9a"

  # Active window
  set-option -g window-status-current-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ffffff'

  # Message
  set-option -g message-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ecf0c1'
  set-option -g message-command-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ecf0c1'

  # When Commands are run
  set -g message-style "fg=#0f111b,bg=#686f9a"
```

## Konsole

Copy `spaceduck.colorscheme` to the `.local/share/konsole/`. After that run `konsoleprofile colors="spaceduck"` OR in Konsole's settings navigate to `Configure Konsole...` > `Profiles` > Select your active profile e.g. `Shell (Default)` > `Edit...` > `Appearence` > Find and select `SpaceDuck` in the `Color scheme & font` > Press `Apply`.

## Termux

Copy `spaceduck.properties` file to the `~/.termux/` and rename it to `colors.properties`. After that exit Termux's session and launch it again.
Note: if you have Termux:Styling plugin installed - changing color scheme with it will overwrite `colors.properties` file with selected theme.

## Xresources

Copy the settings from `spaceduck.xresources` to your `~/.Xresources` file, or you can include it from a separate file with `#include "path/to/spaceduck.xresources"`, just be sure to specify the directory that the file is located in to `xrdb` with [`xrdb -I$HOME ~/.Xresources`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_resources#Include_files).

```Xresources
! special
*.foreground:   #ecf0c1
*.background:   #0f111b
*.cursorColor:  #ecf0c1

! black
*.color0:       #000000
*.color8:       #686f9a

*.color14:      #7a5ccc

*.color7:       #686f9a
*.color15:      #f0f1ce
```

## Mintty

Themes are usually found on the `/usr/share/mintty/themes/` folder. Either copy the `spaceduck.minttyrc` as `/usr/share/mintty/themes/spaceduck` or create a `spaceduck` file in such folder and copy the following text:

```conf

# vivid
copy `spaceduck-vivid.yml` to your `.config` then add `export LS_COLORS="$(vivid generate ~/.config/spaceduck-vivid.yml)"` to the end of your `.bashrc`

## Rio
For more information on [Rio](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio), check out their repository. To get Spaceduck colors in your Rio terminal, copy the `spaceduck.toml` file to your rio `.config/rio/themes/` directory. Then, if not already created, set up your Rio config file at `.config/rio/config.toml`, and reference the theme using `theme="spaceduck"`

*Note:* You will need to reload your terminal for the changes to take effect.
