# Spaceduck terminal theme ðŸš€ðŸ¦†

A intergalactic space theme for your terminal! This is the spaceduck repo for terminal themes. If you're looking for other applications here's the link to the [spaceduck home](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck).

**Color Disclaimer:**

I've personally swapped the yellow and purple colors in most terminal themes.
This is a personal preference as I've found it to render the colorscheme how I like since Spaceduck is dark purple oriented. Feel free to change the colorscheme locally to be more semantically correct! I'm open to change the repo here if any bugs are found however.
Take a look at [this thread](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck-terminal/pull/2) to see the visual differences at this change.

## Terminal.app MacOS

To get the theme into the [Mac Terminal app](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)>), download the `spaceduck.terminal` file and import it into your settings.

## Alacritty

The color scheme for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is in the `spaceduck.yml` file or you can copy it here!

```YAML
# Space Duck

  # Default colors
  primary:
    background: '#0f111b'
    foreground: '#ecf0c1'

```

## st

The color theme for [st](https://st.suckless.org/) is located in `spaceduck.h`, open `config.h` (usually in `~/.local/src/st`), search for `static const char *colorname`, delete that part of the configuration until `unsigned int defaultcs = 257;` replace that with the content of `spaceduck.h`, save the file and exit your editor, then run `sudo make install` where st is located to recompile it, close the terminal and launch the terminal again and _voila!_, you should have spaceduck up and running!

## Kitty

```JSON
"schemes": [
        {
            "name": "SpaceDuck",
            "foreground": "#ecf0c1",
            "background": "#0f111b",
            "black": "#000000",
            "red": "#e33400",
            "green": "#5ccc96",

            "brightCyan": "#7a5ccc",
            "brightWhite": "#f0f1ce"
        }
```

## Tmux

You can go ahead and check out [readme for tmux here](./tmux/README.md).

But if you're too lazy to click the link you can put this in your tmux.conf for an easy spaceduck themed bottom bar:

```tmux
  # Basic color support setting
  set-option -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

  # Default bar color
  set-option -g status-style bg='#1b1c36',fg='#ecf0c1'

  # Active Pane
  set -g pane-active-border-style "fg=#5ccc96"

  # Inactive Pane
  set -g pane-border-style "fg=#686f9a"

  # Active window
  set-option -g window-status-current-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ffffff'

  # Message
  set-option -g message-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ecf0c1'
  set-option -g message-command-style bg='#686f9a',fg='#ecf0c1'

  # When Commands are run
  set -g message-style "fg=#0f111b,bg=#686f9a"
```

## Konsole

Copy `spaceduck.colorscheme` to the `.local/share/konsole/`. After that run `konsoleprofile colors="spaceduck"` OR in Konsole's settings navigate to `Configure Konsole...` > `Profiles` > Select your active profile e.g. `Shell (Default)` > `Edit...` > `Appearence` > Find and select `SpaceDuck` in the `Color scheme & font` > Press `Apply`.

## Termux

Copy `spaceduck.properties` file to the `~/.termux/` and rename it to `colors.properties`. After that exit Termux's session and launch it again.
Note: if you have Termux:Styling plugin installed - changing color scheme with it will overwrite `colors.properties` file with selected theme.

## Xresources

Copy the settings from `spaceduck.xresources` to your `~/.Xresources` file, or you can include it from a separate file with `#include "path/to/spaceduck.xresources"`, just be sure to specify the directory that the file is located in to `xrdb` with [`xrdb -I$HOME ~/.Xresources`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_resources#Include_files).

```Xresources
! special
*.foreground:   #ecf0c1
*.background:   #0f111b
*.cursorColor:  #ecf0c1

! black
*.color0:       #000000
*.color8:       #686f9a

! red
*.color1:       #e33400
*.color9:       #e33400

! green

*.color3:       #b3a1e6

*.color14:      #7a5ccc

! white
*.color7:       #686f9a
*.color15:      #f0f1ce
```

## Mintty

Themes are usually found on the `/usr/share/mintty/themes/` folder. Either copy the `spaceduck.minttyrc` as `/usr/share/mintty/themes/spaceduck` or create a `spaceduck` file in such folder and copy the following text:

```conf
# REGULAR COLORS
# Color 0
Black=0,0,0             # #000000

# Color 1
Red=227,52,0            # #E33400

# Color 2
Green=92,204,150        # #5CCC96

# Color 3
Yellow=179,161,230      # #B3A1E6

# Color 4

# Color 16
BoldCyan=122,92,204     # #7A5CCC

# Color 17
BoldWhite=240,241,206   # #F0F1CE

# EXTRA COLORS
# Foreground
ForegroundColour=236,240,193    # #ECF0C1
# Background
BackgroundColour=15,17,27       # #0F111B
# Cursor
CursorColour=236,240,193        # #ECF0C1
```

## vivid
Copy `spaceduck-vivid.yml` to your `.config`, then add `export LS_COLORS="$(vivid generate ~/.config/spaceduck-vivid.yml)"` to the end of your `.bashrc` file.

## Terminator
The recommended way to use spaceduck in your Terminator is to create a new profile. If you wish to do so,
you can copy the contents of the `spaceduck.terminator` file and append them to your Terminator config 
file (`~/.config/terminator/config`) as follows:

```config
# ...
[profiles]
  [[default]]
    # WHATEVER YOUR 'default' PROFILE HAS
    # ...
  [[Spaceduck]]
    background_color = "#0F111B"
    cursor_color = "#ECF0C1"
    cursor_color_fg = False
    foreground_color = "#ECF0C1"
    palette = "#000000:#e33400:#5ccc96:#b3a1e6:#00a3cc:#f2ce00:#7a5ccc:#686f9a:#686f9a:#e33400:#5ccc96:#b3a1e6:#00a3cc:#f2ce00:#7a5ccc:#f0f1ce"
    bold_is_bright = True
    #use_theme_colors = True
    #font = <YOUR FONT> <SIZE>
# ...
```

Otherwise, if you wish to have your default profile to have a Spaceduck colorscheme, you can instead
replace the options you wish in the `[[default]]` field in your `config` file.
